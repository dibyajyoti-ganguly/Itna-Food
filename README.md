# Itna-Food 🍔

Hungry? Grab a bite with Itna-Food. Bundled using [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/).

## Description

The app allows you to view all the top-rated restaurants in your location and also enables viewing the menu of each of those joints. We have built a grocery component as well for avaialble groceries.

# Getting Started with the App

This module informs you about the necessary libraries & dependencies you need to download & install prior to running the app. Also, we get to know the available scripts which can be executed.

## Dependencies

### `Parcel`
The zero configuration build tool for the web. Parcel combines a great out-of-the-box development experience with a scalable architecture that can take your project from just getting started to massive production application. No more fiddling with configuration, or spending hours to keep up with best practices – it just works!

### `React`
React is a JavaScript library for rendering user interfaces (UI). UI is built from small units like buttons, text, and images. React lets you combine them into reusable, nestable components. From web sites to phone apps, everything on the screen can be broken down into components. 

React applications are built from isolated pieces of UI called components. A React component is a JavaScript function that you can sprinkle with markup. 

### `React-Router`
React Router is a multi-strategy router for React bridging the gap from React 18 to React 19. You can use it maximally as a React framework or minimally as a library with your own architecture. Like previous versions, React Router can still be used as a simple, declarative routing library. Its only job will be matching the URL to a set of components, providing access to URL data, and navigating around the app.

This strategy is popular for "Single Page Apps" that have their own frontend infrastructure and v6 apps looking for a stress free upgrade. It's particularly good at offline + sync architectures where pending states are rare and users have long running sessions.

### `Tailwind`
A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like flex, pt-4, text-center and rotate-90 that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup. Tailwind is unapologetically modern, and takes advantage of all the latest and greatest CSS features to make the developer experience as enjoyable as possible.

### `Jest`
Jest is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity. It works with projects using: Babel, TypeScript, Node, React, Angular, Vue and more! No additional setup needed. Jest can collect code coverage information from entire projects, including untested files.

Jest uses a custom resolver for imports in your tests, making it simple to mock any object outside of your test’s scope. You can use mocked imports with the rich Mock Functions API to spy on function calls with readable test syntax.

## Installing

* How/where to clone the repository:
```
git clone "https://github.com/dibyajyoti-ganguly/Itna-Food.git"
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
